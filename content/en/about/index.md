Welcome to our website!

We are a team of experienced developers and testers who have worked for major European companies and are familiar with international team cooperation.

We are a highly professional team with ten years of experience in developing financial-related products. We pay great attention to every detail and the performance and stability of each product. To ensure the quality of our products, we use the latest development, testing, and operations technologies, such as DevOps, cloud-native, microservices architecture (MSA), and Kubernetes, to provide users with the best possible experience.

In addition to our technical skills, business English is also one of our important advantages. We can communicate with customers fluently in English to ensure smooth project progress and meet the needs of our partners.

If you have any questions about cooperation or consultation with us, please feel free to send an email to jason.wang@aiyax.com, and we will respond to your email and contact you as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to our team, and we look forward to working with you!
